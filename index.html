    <p>I am a enthusiastic history buff and amateur cook. I will be listing some of my favorite recipes from the days of yore. To begin with, I'll start off with a simple custard sauce from eighteenth century England, although you will find that there is not much difference with modern cusatard sauces today. The addition of rose water, which adds a nice floral note tot he sauce, is the main difference you might notice with modern sauces of this kind.</p>

    <p>Custard sauce is a common ingredient for british desserts in the eighteenth centuury, as well as today. The steamed puddings of the time were savory, as sugar was cost prohibitive. The custard sauce provides the necessary sweetness without overpowering the puddings. The addition of rose water gives the sauce a nice eighteenth century touch, and differs from the standard sauces you may see in the UK today.</p>
        
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 drops rose water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp brandy</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In the top of a double boiler, beat the eggs yolks with the sugar and the salt.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and the cream and stir well.</li>
        <li>Set the pot over (not in) gently boiling water and cook, stirring constantly, until the custard is thick enough to coate the back of a spoon (about 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the rose water and brandy</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Note: This sauce can be served hot or cold. It will thicken as it cools. </p>

        <h3>Spotted Dog</h3>

        <p>Spotted dog is the classic example of steamed pudding of the nineteenth century. Easy to make, a tad savory with nice fruity notes from the currants, and a beautiful presentation make this a must have dish for anyone practicing historical cooking. The dish is also referred to as spotted dick.</p>
